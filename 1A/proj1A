Hello world! This is text. My name is Karma Woeser. This is CS 212. 

The profosser's name is Hank Childs. I'm a computer science student at the University of Oregon.

I'm currently in my Humanities class writing this. I'm waiting for my math class to start. 

I'm going to finish this assisgnment by the time class starts. This summer I went to California.

I have never been to Africa, but I've traveled to many places around the world.

Like India, Swizterland, Canada, and Bhutan. China is bad. 

Accessing vi was kinda confusing, why would they make the : such a main tool. 

Actually I guess it makes sense. It's actually not that bad once you figure it out.

There def way more to vi. I'm excited to learn more just hope I dont get under a B- in this class. 

I hope to get an A. Best case scenario. Hello world. hello world. hello world.
